# the npm website public issue tracker

This is the community space for the npm website, http://www.npmjs.com. It
will be used to announce major changes, forecast what we are working on, and to
field issues with the website.

## What This Repo Is

:white_check_mark: If there are major releases going out, we will write them up here.

:white_check_mark: If you are having issues with the website — it loads
too slow, or if you can't see a page you know exists, or complete a task
you know is possible — **please open an issue here**. If the topic is
sensitive, please [contact support](https://www.npmjs.com/support).

:white_check_mark: If you need something from the website — a new feature,
or improvements in an existing feature — **please open an issue here**. We will
take the feature under consideration: keep in mind, we often have to pass on
really good ideas due to time constraints.
